Welcome to the Chimerical App,

To Get this up and running first you will need to do the following in the terminal
1. cd backend
2. Bundle install
3. rails db:create
4. rails db:migrate
5. rails db:seed
6. rails server
7. Open a new Terminal 
8. cd frontend
9. Open index.html.

Now feel free to have a great time making Chimera!
Every time you run it you will have to go into the backend and run the server.
This will allow the page to operate correctly.

The other option is check it out here on Heroku! https://chimera-maker.herokuapp.com/

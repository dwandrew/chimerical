Welcome to the Chimerical App,

To Get this up and running first you will need to  do the follwing
1. cd backend
2. Bundle install
3. rails db:create
4. rails db:migrate
5. rails db:seed
6. rails server
7. Open a new Terminal 
8. cd frontend
9. Open Index.html.

Now feel free to have a great time making Chimera!
Every time you run it you will have to go into the backened and run the server.
This will allow the Index to operate correctly.
